To get pyAudioAnalysis working, I needed to have the following packages installed via `sudo apt-get install`:
  - python3-dev
  - python3-tk

R was a little complicated to set up:

I needed to make my `site-library` folder writable.
  - `sudo chmod o+w /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/`

I needed to update my .Rprofile file to set my default CRAN repo. I chose WUSTL.

I needed to update the version of R installed by the apt package manager:
  - `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E084DAB9`
  - `sudo echo "deb http://cran.wustl.edu/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list`
  - `sudo apt update`
  - `sudo apt upgrade r-base r-base-dev`
  - `sudo apt update`
  - `sudo apt upgrade`

I needed the following packages for a variety of dependencies in primaryobjects's R script, sound.R. These are the ones I installed with `sudo apt-get install`:
  - lubcurl-dev
  - libcurl4-openssl-dev
  - fftw-dev
  - fftw3
  - fftw3-dev
  - pkg-config

I changed `rpart-plot` to `rpart.plot` in sound.R. Not sure if this will work.

bioacoustics package failed because I did not have cmake. I built cmake from source.

Upgrading R to most recent version and upgrading all the packages seemed to work.
